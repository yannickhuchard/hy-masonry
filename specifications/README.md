# HY Masonry - Animated Masonry Layout Library

## Overview

HY Masonry is a JavaScript library that provides an animated masonry layout as a web component. It creates a living, breathing layout where each box is an animated organism that can morph, grow, and respond to user interactions.

## Core Concept

The library transforms traditional masonry layouts into living organisms where:
- Each box has its own animation cycle
- Boxes can morph between different sizes dynamically
- The entire layout feels alive and responsive
- User interactions trigger temporary morphing effects

## Key Features

### 1. Living Organisms

- Default breathing/pulsing animations
- Smooth transitions between states
- Organic movement patterns

### 2. Dynamic Morphing
- Boxes can temporarily change size (e.g., 1x2 â†’ 1x4)
- Morphing triggered by:
  - User hover
  - Long press (preview mode)
  - Programmatic events
  - Automatic cycles

### 3. Intuitive Configuration
- Simple JSON-based configuration
- Responsive design support
- Customizable animation parameters
- Easy integration with React/ShadCN

### 4. Web Component Architecture
